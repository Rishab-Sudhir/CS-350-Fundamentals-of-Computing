This course is intended to provide students with a baggage of fundamental notions that apply to computing systems. In this context, the concept of "system" is willfully generic, as one of the main objectives of this course is to cover reasoning approaches, mathematical tools, and modeling techniques that can be applied to a multitude of system instances. By the end of the course, students who take CS-350 will develop the ability to map new problems onto existing solutions or, at the very least, onto existing approaches towards a solution. Indeed, this course will help the careful student realize that many system instances have a common denominator of challenges and issues that can be approached using well-established techniques and abstractions.
